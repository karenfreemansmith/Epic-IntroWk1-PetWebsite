    <h3>Finding Shiva</h3>
    <p>
      A neighbor offered us a kitten named <em>Simba</em>, but when she came to our house she got a
      new name. Johnathan's favorite diety at the time was Shiva, <em>the god of destruction</em>. And
      that is how Shiva got her name. She has been living up to it ever since.
